also requires ffmpeg to be exicutable via command line/terminal 
it also needs the .mp4 of the video for creating a black same length with subtitle overlay

bash part works on both windows and Mac (tested)
ffmpeg works on windows (tested, will test on mac soon)

add video to you project and make it an overlay with type add or screen 
for Shotcut overlay "ADD" works well

folder example :

Please note that this idea came from RCShim on youtube he just used .vbs script and as my work flow does include a mac too, I wanted the portability as well with this script https://www.youtube.com/c/RcschimBlogspot
